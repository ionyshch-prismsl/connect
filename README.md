# Prism Connect SDK

The Prism Connect SDK is a first class client library for the Prism Connect API. In addition to support for making all of the necessary network calls to the API, the SDK provides a standard suite of abstracted computer vision algorithms for interacting most effectively with the API. Finally, the SDK comes with a curated set of small example executables that can be used to build more complex applications, and they double as utilities for interacting with the API from the command line.

## Design

Simplicity, modularity, and flatness inform the design of the SDK. Here's how you query for all of the Prism accounts that can be accessed through a particular API token:

```c++
#include <iostream>

#include <api/client.h>
#include <api/environment.h>

int main() {
    prism::connect::api::Client client{prism::connect::api::environment::ApiRoot(),
                                       prism::connect::api::environment::ApiToken()};

    auto accounts = client.QueryAccounts();

    for (const auto& account : accounts) {
        std::cout << "Account[" << account.id_ << "]:" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Name: " << account.name_ << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Url: " << account.url_ << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Instruments Url: " << account.instruments_url_ << std::endl;
        std::cout << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Similarly, performing background subtraction on a sequence of input images should be straightforward and fool-proof:

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

#include <opencv2/core.hpp>

#include <processors/background.h>

int main() {
    prism::connect::processors::Background background;

    std::vector<cv::Mat> input_images;

    for (const auto& input_image : input_images) {
        background.AddImage(input_image);
    }

    cv::Mat background_image = background.GetBackgroundImage();
    cv::Mat foreground_mask = background.GetForegroundMask();

    return 0;
}
```

The goal of the SDK is to reduce the number of steps from the surface (aka `int main()`) to the core functionality of processing visual data and POSTing it to the Prism Connect API. This enables and rewards producing small, highly focused and functional executables that perform a single job correctly and efficiently, a critical property of successful embedded development workflows.

## Modules

The SDK is broken up into modules that are each responsible for a specific set of behaviors.

### `api`

To make network calls to the Prism Connect API, use the `api` module, which encapsulates authentication and network services in a single class, the `Client`. Every public method of an instance of `Client` is a network call, with no exceptions. This makes it easy to identify in source code what method calls must be treated as potentially blocking or erroneous.

After successfully constructing a `Client`, one has access to these methods:

```c++
// Get the list of Accounts
std::vector<Account> accounts = client.QueryAccounts();

// Get a specific Account by account id
Account account = client.QueryAccount(id);

// Get the list of Instruments belonging to an Account
std::vector<Instrument> client.QueryInstruments(account);

// Get a specific Instrument belonging to an Account by instrument id
Instrument client.QueryInstrument(account, id);

// Register an unregistered Instrument to an Account
client.RegisterInstrument(account, instrument);

// POST image, video, or time series data to a registered Instrument
client.PostImage(instrument, "ImageKey", std::chrono::system_clock::now(),
                 std::chrono::system_clock::now(), "image.jpg", image_data);
client.PostVideo(instrument, "VideoKey", std::chrono::system_clock::now(),
                 std::chrono::system_clock::now(), "video.mp4", video_data);
client.PostTimeSeries(instrument, "TimeSeriesKey", std::chrono::system_clock::now(), json_data);
// In the above examples, image_data and video_data are std::vector<char>, aka, binary data, and
// json_data is type nlohmann::json, which is defined in an included dependency
```

The classes `Account` and `Instrument` are light classes with essentially all POD (plain old data) type members, and do not interact with the network on their own. Only when used in conjunction with a `Client` will a network call be made on behalf of them.

### `sources`

This module defines a common interface for creating sources for image frames or video frames. Clients of those interfaces can work with pointers to frame sources instead of concrete instantiations of those frame sources. This allows for a common set of executables and algorithms to run against a well defined interface even after changing out the input source.

To implement the interface, extend the `SourceInterface` class defined in `source-interface.h` like in `file-source.h`:

```c++
class FileSource : public SourceInterface {
  public:
    FileSource(const std::string& file_path);

    virtual FramePtr GetFrame() override;

  private:
    void freeFrame(Frame* frame);

    std::ifstream input_file_;
};
```

Here, a source of images is taken from a file, even though a client of `SourceInterface` wouldn't need to know that. Since they only have access to a pointer to `SourceInterface`, they can still use the frames taken from a file to run their algorithms by calling `GetFrame()`.

Several example sources are provided, and this is likely to be the first point of integration for a user of the SDK. Defining the source of frames and codifying that in a subclass of `SourceInterface` is the most critical step in doing a Prism Connect integration through the SDK.

### `processors`

This module provides a standard suite of computer vision algorithms, which under the hood use OpenCV.

### `util`

A catch-all module for bottom of the pyramid algorithms and helpers. `util` has no dependencies on other modules and exists for the sole purpose of removing boilerplate or non-integral code from them.
