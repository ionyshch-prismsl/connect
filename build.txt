Building on MacOS X 10.11 (El Captain)

 1. Install Xcode
 2. Accept developer license (if not done before)
    sudo xcodebuild -license
 3. Install command line developer tools
    sudo xcode-select --install
 4. Install Homebrew
    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
    brew update
 5. (ommitted installing python and python modules, not sure we need them for this project)
 6. Install tools and libraries necessary to build OpenCV
    brew install cmake pkg-config
    brew install jpeg libpng libtiff openexr
 7. (may be we need to install FFMPEG, don't remember, if I did it)
